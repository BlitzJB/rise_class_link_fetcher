# Rise Class Link Fetcher

Our institute uses a portal for operations which is great for its intended function. yet, its UI is very uncomfortable for people who are used to Google Drive player for accessing class recordings. Here i have exploited secutiry vulnerabilities in the portal to extract the Youtube (Unlisted Video) link to each class recording, so i can access the recordings in a familiar and comfortable UI.
